# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.

flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/
    - assets/images/
    - assets/images/placeHolder/Offer/
    - assets/images/placeHolder/restro/
    - assets/images/placeHolder/veg/
    - assets/images/placeHolder/cake/
    - assets/images/placeHolder/
    - assets/images/grocery/
    - assets/images/icons/bikeRide_icon/
    - assets/images/icons/transaction_icon/
    - assets/images/icons/pickup_icons/
    - assets/images/icons/
    - assets/images/logos/
    - assets/images/food_images/
    - assets/images/offer_images/
    - assets/images/restaurants_images/

    - assets/images/icons/refer_earn_2.png
  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
     - family: Schyler
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/times-new-roman-corsivo.ttf
     - family: BoldItalic
       fonts:
         - asset: assets/DroidSerif-BoldItalic.ttf



  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700

  # The position of the splash image can be set with android_gravity and ios_content_mode
  # parameters.  Both default to center.
